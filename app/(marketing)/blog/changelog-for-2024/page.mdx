## Introduction

ACAI is built in partnership with XUNA AI, a trusted infrastructure provider specializing in large-scale AI systems. This partnership ensures that the technology powering ACAI is built on proven, production-grade foundations that plumbers and HVAC businesses can rely on for handling real customer calls.

## Who XUNA AI Is

XUNA AI serves as the infrastructure partner behind ACAI. Founded by Joud Mansour, XUNA AI focuses on building and maintaining large-scale AI systems and infrastructure used by enterprise-level organizations. Their work centers on creating reliable, scalable AI solutions that meet the demands of production environments.

## Why This Partnership Matters for ACAI

The partnership with XUNA AI provides ACAI with several key advantages:

**Infrastructure Foundation**: XUNA's infrastructure gives ACAI access to proven systems designed for reliability and scale.

**Production-Grade Reliability**: The underlying technology has been tested and deployed in demanding enterprise environments.

**Responsible AI Development**: XUNA's approach to AI development aligns with building systems that work consistently and predictably.

For plumbers and HVAC businesses, this means the AI receptionist handling their customer calls runs on infrastructure built to perform reliably when it matters most.

## Trusted by Industry Leaders

XUNA AI works with or is trusted by organizations including NVIDIA, Google, Capsule, Luma, Smartcat, Hilton, Zillow, and GoTiger. This gives ACAI a strong foundation to build on, ensuring the technology supporting service businesses is backed by systems proven at scale.

## Our Role as ACAI

ACAI operates as an independent business focused on serving plumbers and HVAC companies. While we leverage XUNA's infrastructure, our focus is on execution, reliability, and customer outcomes. We build applied, vertical-specific AI solutions tailored to the unique needs of service businesses—from handling appointment scheduling to managing after-hours calls.
